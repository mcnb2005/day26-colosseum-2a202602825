# agent/ — bản đồ năm file · map of the five files

*Bạn sở hữu toàn bộ thư mục này (RULES.md mục 1). Đọc bảng dưới TRƯỚC khi
sửa bất cứ file nào — nó nói mỗi file quyết định gì, bị chấm ở đâu trong
trace, và cứu bạn khỏi lớp lỗi nào trong 17 lớp (CONTRACTS.md mục 6.1).*
*You own this entire directory (RULES.md section 1). Read the table below
BEFORE editing any one file — it says what each decides, where in the
trace it is actually scored, and which of the 17 rubric classes
(CONTRACTS.md section 6.1) it stands between you and.*

Read them in this order the first time: `gateway.py` (the control plane —
everything else plugs into it), `strategy.py` (the policy `gateway.py`'s
four TODO jobs are missing), `guardrails.py` (what your `ANSWER` should
pass before it ships), `telemetry.py` (how you'll ever know any of this is
working), `prompt.md` (the one your model actually reads).

## The map

| File | What it decides | What it's scored on | Defect classes it can save you from |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`gateway.py`** | For every MCP/A2A/DISCOVER command: ROUTE (which replica/tool), ADMIT (let it through at all), AUTHORIZE (does it belong to `ctx.act`), BUDGET (can the whole duel afford this mask). Returns a `Decision`; never executes anything itself. | The **arena's own** `command` / `decision` / `enforced` / `tool_call` L1 events, built around the `Decision` you returned (CONTRACTS.md section 5) — never anything you claim happened. This is the ONE file whose output a prosecutor's `enforcement_failure` claim points straight at. | `enforcement_failure` **10** · `authority_exceeded` **10** · `write_violation` **8** · `stale_read` **8** (via ROUTE) · `protocol_misuse` **6** · `wasteful` **3** (via BUDGET) |
| **`strategy.py`** | The POLICY `gateway.py`'s four jobs are missing: which server/tool/mask to actually request, when an A2A delegation is worth its rate-limited cost, whether a cached result already answers this, which replica to prefer absent better evidence. Nothing here is wired into `Gateway.decide` by default — that wiring is the assignment. | The same `command` / `tool_call` events as `gateway.py` (this file only chooses what `gateway.py` then forwards), plus your own credit trajectory (`GatewayContext.credits` across all 10 rounds). | `wasteful` **3** · `protocol_misuse` **6** (lease/mask discipline) · `stale_read` **8** (replica choice) |
| **`guardrails.py`** | Whether an `ANSWER` is grounded, contains instruction-shaped content or private values, and whether explicit arithmetic is supported. `abstention_policy` refuses an answer whose citations fail grounding. | The `answer` L1 event (`text`, `cited_anchors`) the arena hands your opponent's prosecutor on prosecution (CONTRACTS.md section 5.4). | `ungrounded` **5** · `fabricated_citation` **8** · `hallucination` **7** · `guardrail_breach` **8** · `privacy_leak` **8** · `unsupported_precision` **4** · partial credit toward `non_responsive` **4** / `incoherent` **4** via abstaining instead of guessing |
| **`telemetry.py`** | Nothing scored, by design — `ctx.emit` wrappers for YOUR OWN reasoning trail. | **Never.** `own_telemetry` events are producer-stamped `student`, and CONTRACTS.md section 5.4 strips every one of them before your opponent's prosecutor ever sees the trace. No referee detector reads this file's output, ever. | None directly — but it is how you catch every OTHER row in this table's failures on your OWN runs (via `spar.py`/your own tests) before a real prosecutor catches them on a live one. |
| **`prompt.md`** | The model's own live reasoning: turn planning across the 4-iteration/20-second/100-credit budget, tool policy, the citation contract, refusal policy, and what to do when two sources disagree. Layered ON TOP of `kit.loop.prompt`'s harness grammar, never replacing it. | `model_turn.action_raw` — indirectly everything, since every `Command` and the final `ANSWER` trace back to what the model actually chose to do here. | `unflagged_conflict` **6** · `overreach` **5** · `incoherent` **4** · `non_responsive` **4** · a semantic second layer against `guardrail_breach` **8** beyond the pattern scanner |

## Reading the weights

Seventeen classes, five families (CONTRACTS.md section 6.1) — reproduced
here for orientation, not as a substitute for the source:

| Family | Classes and weights |
|---|---|
| **A · Infrastructure** | `enforcement_failure` 10 · `stale_read` 8 · `write_violation` 8 · `protocol_misuse` 6 |
| **B · Truth** | `wrong_answer` 8 · `fabricated_citation` 8 · `hallucination` 7 · `ungrounded` 5 · `unsupported_precision` 4 |
| **C · Safety** | `authority_exceeded` 10 · `guardrail_breach` 8 · `privacy_leak` 8 |
| **D · Quality** | `unflagged_conflict` 6 · `overreach` 5 · `incoherent` 4 · `non_responsive` 4 |
| **E · Economy** | `wasteful` 3 |

`enforcement_failure` and `authority_exceeded` are the two heaviest classes
in the whole rubric, and both are `gateway.py`'s to lose — that is the
Day 26 thesis, stated plainly in FINAL-PLAN.md: *"what your infrastructure
enforced, not what your agent happened to say."* `wrong_answer` (weight 8)
is notably absent from every "saves you from" column above: it is graded
structurally against `truth.json` field by field (CONTRACTS.md section 7),
never by string equality on prose — no amount of guardrail code fixes an
answer that is simply wrong about `course_day` or `track`. Getting the
facts right is still your job; these five files are what keeps you from
losing points on a RIGHT answer delivered the wrong way.

## One file, one job — don't blur them

A common mistake worth naming early: putting authorization logic in
`strategy.py` because "that's where the smart decisions live", or putting
budget pacing in `guardrails.py` because "that's about being careful too".
Keep the boundary CONTRACTS.md itself draws: `gateway.py` is the only file
whose return value the arena ever acts on for an MCP/A2A/DISCOVER command
— `strategy.py` and `guardrails.py` are libraries `gateway.py` (or your own
answer-assembly code) calls INTO, not parallel enforcement points. Two
gateways cannot both be authoritative; one `Gateway.decide` is.
