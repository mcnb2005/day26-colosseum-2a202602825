"""eval/prosecute.py — Task 2: the prosecutor (CONTRACTS.md section 6.1).

    def prosecute(trace: list[dict], answer: dict, card: dict) -> dict:
        '''Return {"v": 1, "claims": [...]}. SYNCHRONOUS, no I/O, no network,
        5 s deadline. `trace` is the opponent's L1 events only (CONTRACTS.md
        section 5.4).'''

Your gateway (`agent/gateway.py`) is what your infrastructure ENFORCES. This file is
what you can PROVE about somebody else's. CONTRACTS.md section 6.1's rule that
matters most: **no claim, no damage** — an attack that lands but you cannot cite
evidence for earns nothing, and a claim that misreads its own evidence costs YOU.

IMPLEMENTED DETECTORS
---------------------
`detect_enforcement_failure` handles the heaviest mechanical class. Sixteen
conservative `_hook_*` detectors cover the remaining rubric classes using the
opponent's trace and answer. Every emitted claim carries specific event, span,
or anchor evidence and still passes through the family/quota budget below.

Also provided so you spend your time on DETECTION, not on JSON shape:

  * `evt_ref` / `span_ref` / `anchor_ref` — the three evidence-ref grammars
    (CONTRACTS.md section 6.1: `"evt:NNNN"` | `"answer.span:N"` | `"anchor:<A>"`).
  * `group_calls(trace)` — buckets L1 events into per-`command` groups
    (`command`/`decision`/`enforced`/`tool_call`/`tool_result`/`mutations`), the
    correlation `detect_enforcement_failure` (and most other detectors) need.
  * `split_sentences(text)` — the exact `answer.span:N` sentence split.
  * `ProsecutionBudget` — a claim accumulator that enforces "at most 4 claims, at
    most 1 per family" BY CONSTRUCTION, so a detector that fires five times cannot
    accidentally over-file; it silently keeps the first per family and reports what
    it dropped via `.dropped`.
  * `score_prosecutor(fn, fixtures)` — measures ANY `prosecute`-shaped callable
    against `fixtures/prosecution/labelled/`, so you find out where your detector
    is wrong before an opponent's trace costs you a duel.

THE ECONOMICS — READ THIS BEFORE YOU WRITE A DETECTOR
---------------------------------------------------------
CONTRACTS.md section 6.2's outcome table: a `verified` claim earns `+weight`; a
`false` claim costs `-0.8 * weight` (both `* round_scale`, applied once at fold
time — not this module's concern). Filing blind is +EV exactly when

    p(verified) * weight  >  (1 - p(verified)) * 0.8 * weight

which rearranges to `p > 0.8 / 1.8 = 4/9 = 0.4444...` — and because BOTH sides of
that inequality carry a factor of `weight`, IT CANCELS. The break-even is
**44.4% for every one of the 17 classes, weight-10 `enforcement_failure` and
weight-3 `wasteful` alike.** There is no weight to shop for.

Contrast the flat penalty an earlier draft of this game used, and never shipped —
`break_even_probability(cls, scheme="flat")` below computes it purely so this
arithmetic is demonstrable, not asserted; nothing in this module ever scores a
claim under it. A flat `-4` makes blind filing +EV whenever `p > 4 / (weight + 4)`.
For `enforcement_failure` (weight 10)
that is `4/14 = 28.6%` — visibly easier to clear than for `wasteful` (weight 3,
`4/7 = 57.1%`), so a prosecutor optimizing under a flat penalty would rationally
shotgun the heavy classes and go quiet on the light ones. **Under the scheme this
lab actually uses, that strategy is not rational: every class costs the same
44.4% conviction rate to be worth filing at all.** File what you can prove, not
what pays the most if you happen to be right.

Stdlib only. No network, no unseeded randomness, no wall-clock inside `prosecute`
itself (the 5 s deadline is measured by the CALLER — `score_prosecutor` here, and
the real referee in the arena — never baked into the claims themselves).
